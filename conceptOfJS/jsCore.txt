#JavaScript, composite data types (objects) are complex structures that can hold multiple values and are based on the Object type.
#You're trying to access the character of a string using array notation, but that's not correct. Strings don't support array-like indexing directly. You should use charAt or just treat the string as an array of characters.
# find returns the first element that matches a condition and stops, while forEach executes a function on every element without returning a value.




diff indexOf(ele) & lastIndexOf(ele)
indexOf(ele) returns the first index at which a given element can be found.
lastIndexOf(ele) returns the last index at which a given element can be found

             4) by usig "parce" we can convert jsont ot object



             
4. where to use map()
